# voice-assistant
hey there , I have been working on a voice assistant for a short while . The uniqueness about my voice assistant is that it is according to me the most easiest code to understand . i used several modules and api in it like GTTS for conversion of voice to text , wolframaplha to equate mathematical equations ,selenium to access browsing apps like chrome ,firefox etc
